Hello! This document details the process required to setup your Marimba development environment.
It's not that bad, but it took me a while to figure out what to do, so hopefully this document helps you out.

## Getting started
1. Install Visual Studio 2013 from Dreamspark.

Look for the Visual Studio 2013 installation on Dreamspark. As a UW student, you can get this for free. Download it (it's 2GB) and install it. You can leave all the defaults as is.

2. Setup the Visual Studio projects.

Ask the previous developer of Marimba to add you to the uwcbc organization. To actually get the code, install a git client and clone the repo. To open the project, double click the .sln file in the new uwcbc-marimba folder. Everything should be working at this point! If not, ask the previous developer.

3. OPTIONAL: Integrate Visual Studio with Git.

Ideally, you should be able to check-in and check-out changes directly in Visual Studio. This is up to whether you like the convenience of an IDE doing things for you, or like using a shell to run git commands.
